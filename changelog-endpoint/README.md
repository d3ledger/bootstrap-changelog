# Changelog endpoint
The `changelog-endpoint` module is a REST service intended for Iroha data model migrations: adding signatories, setting account details, creating domains, appending roles etc.

## Simplified flow
1) The service executes given Groovy script that implements `ChangelogInterface`.
2) Created changelog transaction(generated by Groovy script) is accompanied with a changelog history transaction in order to keep track of changes.
3) Then, transactions are combined into an atomic batch. 
4) Superuser signs recently created batch and sends it to Iroha as MST. 

## Brief API documentation
Available endpoints:
1) `/changelog/changelogFile` - executes changelog Groovy script file which absolute path is defined in a JSON request.  
2) `/changelog/changelogScript`- executes changelog Groovy script which code is defined in a JSON request.
 
Complete documentation is available at http://localhost:9999/apidocs/

## Config review (changelog.properties)
1) `changelog.irohaHost` - host of Iroha
2) `changelog.irohaPort` - port of Iroha
3) `changelog.port` - the changelog endpoint port

## Integration
The service may be run as a Docker container
